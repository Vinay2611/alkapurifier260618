        <p><b>Scientists found that healthy drinkable water consists of the following :-</b></p>
        <ul class="anti-oxidant">
            <li>TDS   (Total Dissolved Solids) : It is a measurement on the content and level of natural salts and minerals in the water.</li>
            <li>pH     ( Potential Hydrogen)    : pH denotes a measurement of acidity or alkalinity of a solution and a number on a logarithmic scale. The

                pH range is from 0 to 14, with being 7.0 represents of neutrality. Lower number below 7 indicates acidity and higher number above 7 indicates alkalinity in a

                liquid. The pH range in a healthy human blood will be measured between 7.36 to 7.7 making the blood slightly alkaline. If the pH level is below 7.36

                then the blood becomes acidic and prone to acidosis which causes all kind of illness.
            </li>
            <li>ORP  ( Oxidation Reduction Potential) : “ORP is a measure of the cleanliness of the water & its ability to break down contaminants”.  It has a range of –2,000 to + 2,000 and units are in “mV” (millivolts). It is the index that shows Oxidation or Reduction power.  Since ozone is an oxidizer, we are only concerned with positive ORP levels (above 0 mV).</li>
            <li>MINERALS : The important minerals in water which are necessary to increase metabolism, help growth and development in human

                body are Mg (magnesium), Ca ( calcium), K (potassium) and Na (sodium).</li>
            <li> NMR  (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) : NMR  is also a water molecule measurement of cluster size.</li>

        </ul>

    <p> <b>    All the above things are to be taken into consideration when we choose water to drink. Not any other kind of purified water can give you</b></p>
